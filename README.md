# ECE253-Digital image processing
This is a course assignment for digital image processing (UCSD-fall23-Professor Trivedi, Mohan M.)

Here I will share my coursework, the four quizzes I attended, and as much as I can recall the scope and knowledge of the final exam, for the benefit of those who come after me. 

I have to say that my assignments are not entirely correct (as they did not get full marks for some parts), but in general terms and in some details, it may provide you with some ideas and suggestions.
